**Event Planner Project Overview:**

This project aims to develop a user-friendly website that enables clients to effortlessly estimate costs for hosting business conference events. The application will allow users to select and price various conference rooms, choose add-ons like microphones and projectors, and arrange catering for a specified number of attendees.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Corporate Retreats:** A company planning a multi-day retreat can use the platform to quickly assess room availability, equipment needs, and meal options, streamlining the budgeting process and ensuring they meet their employeesâ€™ needs.

2. **Industry Conferences:** Organizers of large conferences can easily compare costs for different setups, making it simpler to create tailored packages for sponsors or attendees, ultimately enhancing their event planning efficiency.

3. **Workshops and Seminars:** Educational institutions or trainers can utilize the website to manage smaller events, ensuring they have all necessary amenities while keeping within budget constraints.

**Challenges Without This Solution:**

- **Time-Consuming Pricing:** Without this platform, event planners may spend hours or even days contacting venues and suppliers for quotes, delaying the planning process and potentially leading to lost opportunities.
  
- **Budget Overruns:** Manually tracking room capacities, equipment availability, and catering options can lead to significant miscalculations, resulting in unexpected expenses that could jeopardize the event's success.

- **Inflexibility:** The inability to quickly modify selections and recalculate costs may discourage clients from exploring different configurations, limiting their creativity in event planning.

This project aims to simplify the event planning process, providing a comprehensive solution that saves time, reduces stress, and enhances the overall experience for both planners and attendees.
